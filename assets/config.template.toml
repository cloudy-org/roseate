# the image is significantly bigger than your monitor can even display, so to save memory 
# we downsample the image. Downsampling decreases the amount of memory eaten up by the image 
# at the cost of CPU time wasted actually resizing the image. The bigger the image the more time 
# it will take to downsample but we think memory savings are more valuable in this circumstance.
# 
# If you do not wish for such memory savings and you prefer faster image load time disable 
# this optimization.
# 
# If you want your image quality back when zooming into your image, 
# you might want to also enable the "dynamic_sampling" image optimization too.
