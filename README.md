You can find devlogs **in video format** on my youtube channel; I have a playlist for it here: **https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI8mjQYZec82ZajoDnDkAicBarEZ1yPd-**

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation
As Roseate is in heavy development I won't offer packages and binaries yet so you'll need to compile the application from source.

## üèó Build from source
### Prerequisites:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Cargo (Rust **`1.80.0`**+ is required!).

- Linux dependecies for [eframe](https://crates.io/crates/eframe):
  - [libxcb](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libxcb/)
  - [libxkbcommon](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/libxkbcommon/)
  - [openssl](https://archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/openssl/)

1. Clone the repo.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/cloudy-org/roseate
cd roseate
```
2. Pull the cirrus tool kit submodule.
```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### ‚öôÔ∏è For Development
At this stage, for development, you would just run ``cargo run``. If you would like to install it to your system continue ahead to the [next section](#-install-into-your-system).

4. Run dev binary.
```sh
cargo run
```
To run Roseate in development with an image, append `--` and pass an image path after like so:
```sh
cargo run -- ./anime_girl.png
```
To run with verbose debugging, call cargo run with the `RUST_LOG=DEBUG` environment variable:
```sh
RUST_LOG=DEBUG cargo run -- ./anime_girl.png
```
```

... (truncated for the sanity of this readme)
```

#### üéÄ Install into your system.
Installing it to your system I advise you use GNU Make or else copy the commands from the "[Makefile](./Makefile)" (you will need to install Make if you haven't already).

4. Build the release binary.
```sh
make
```
5. Install to your system.
```sh
sudo make install
```
6. Then the `roseate` binary will be available in your terminal.
```sh
roseate
```

Open an image by passing its path.
```sh
roseate ./anime_girls.png
```
You might want to also set the binary at ``/usr/bin/roseate`` as your default image viewer so double clicking on images calls it. You can look up how to perform that for your desktop environment or OS.
